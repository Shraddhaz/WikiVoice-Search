# WikiVoice-Search
Implemented NLP using Api.Ai and used it in an android application that searches for a given keyword by fetching the right one from a sentence.

WikiVoice Search takes input from user about a topic or some personality they want to search for. If the user gives an input like: "Tell me about Barack Obama" or "Who is Sachin Tendulkar?" or "What is a Laptop?" then it takes the keyword from the sentence and gives a brief introduction about that topic along with giving the user a choice to see the Wikipedia webpage.

The application is useful as it searches for any topic on Wikipedia without going through the trouble of searching for information on search engines.

A website was also created for this using Bootstrap on which the .apk file is uploaded.
